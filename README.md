🏨 Room Upgrade Prediction Post-Peak
This project explores a machine learning approach to predict whether hotel guests will upgrade their room after the peak season. By leveraging guest behavior data, booking characteristics, and distribution patterns, the model aims to assist hotel management in targeted upselling strategies, especially during the low-demand periods following peak season.

🔍 Problem Statement
After the peak season, hotels often experience a decline in bookings and revenue. One potential strategy to maintain profitability is to identify guests likely to upgrade their room voluntarily — allowing personalized offers and marketing campaigns.

The central question:

"Can we predict which guests are most likely to upgrade their rooms after the peak season ends?"

📌 Objectives
-Build a supervised classification model to predict room upgrade behavior (0 = No Upgrade, 1 = Upgrade).

-Handle class imbalance and evaluate performance beyond accuracy (e.g. F1-score, ROC-AUC).

-Apply techniques like threshold tuning, model calibration, and error analysis.

-Provide actionable insights for hotel sales & marketing post-peak.
